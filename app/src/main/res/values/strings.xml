        <item>Spodoptera exempta (Walker)/Mythimna separata Walker/Spodoptera mauritia Boisduval</item>
        <item>Gross feeding damage to foliage, growing points, and young stems. Severe infestation results in total defoliation or destruction of the plant to ground level. Eggs: Pale-yellowish and becomes dark brown just before hatching. The black head-capsules of the larvae can be seen through the shells. Each egg is about 0.5 mm in diameter, conical with a slightly rounded apex and a densely sculpted surface; Larvae: Develops from grey-green with white-yellow stripes down its back when small, to black with thin blue lines down the middle of the back and yellow-green lines outside the blue lines when fully grown. It measures 2 to 3cm long, has a velvety-black upper surface with pale lateral lines, a green or yellow ventral surface, and no hairs on the body. There are three parallel lines on the dorsal surface of the prothoracic (first body) segment and a stripe running longitudinally down the mid-dorsal surface of the body is always paler than the black pigmentation on either side of it. The head is always shiny-black; Pupa: Mahogany-brown, 10-14mm long, with a smooth, shiny surface; Adult: It is 14-18mm long and has a 29-32mm wing span. The abdomen is covered with pale grey-brown scales (except for the tip in the female which has black hair-scales). Forewings are dark-brown with distinctive grey-black markings. Hindwings are white with dark veins.</item>
        <item>Many animals, birds and insects prey on the African armyworm at different stages of its life cycle. These natural enemies should be encouraged by maintaining natural surroundings with plenty of breeding places for them, including trees and shrubs. Night birds and bats feed on the African armyworm moths, and lacewings, wasps, parasitic wasps and spiders eat the caterpillars; Avoid burning and overgrazing of grasslands which are the natural habitat and food store of the caterpillars. Burning often causes outbreaks because as soon as temperatures rise, eggs are laid in large quantities on the fresh new grass.</item>

        <item>Egg: Laid in clusters covered with short yellowish brown hairs from the abdominal tips of the female moths. Each egg is pearly white, round, and has a ridged surface; Larva: Brown or green with longitudinal stripes, with black spots ringing the body about one-fourth of the body length behind the head; Adult: Has 15-20mm long grey-brown body, and a wingspan of 30-38mm. The forewings are grey to reddish-brown with a strongly variegated pattern and paler lines along the veins, and the hindwings are greyish-white with grey margins.</item>
        <item>Seedbeds should be established far from large areas of weeds, remove weeds from areas outside of fields, and plow all uncultivated land. In insecticides, sprays are more effective than granules. High dosages are required to kill large armyworm and cutworm larvae. Spraying should be done late in the afternoon before the larvae leave their resting places to climb up the plants. Because damage is normally concentrated in discrete areas of a rice field, only areas where damage occurs should be sprayed.</item>

        <item>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)</item>
        <item>The first sign of leaffolder infestation is the presence of moths in the field. Longitudinal and transparent whitish streaks on damaged leaves, tubular folded leaves, and leaf tips sometimes fastened to the basal part of leaf are caused by larvae feeding. Severely damaged plants appear burned with many folded leaves. Under heavy attack, a field will appear gray white from a distance. Eggs: Translucent, yellowish white, oval, 0.90 mm long and 0.39 mm wide, and almost flat with a slightly convex surface; Larva: Young larvae are translucent but turn yellowish green as they mature, head capsules and thoraxes are brown, have one pair of dark spots on the abdomen near the head; Pupa: Light brown, but turns reddish brown toward moth emergence; Adult: 10-12mm long and has wing span of 13-15mm; light brown with shiny, brownish yellow wings adorned with dark, broad margins, and two to three dark vertical stripes; appears triangular when at rest.</item>
        <item>Careful use of nitrogenous fertilizer in split applications is recommended. Removal of grassy weeds from rice fields and surrounding borders prevents the buildup of rice leaffolders on alternate hosts. However, chemical control is the only practical method to control increasing leaffolder infestation during crop growth. Numerous insecticides that have been identified for control are most effective as foliar sprays. But foliar sprays have to be repeated because they are often washed off by frequent rains. Granular insecticides broadcast into water are ineffective. Since leaffolders can attack the crop during any growth stage, fields should be monitored weekly.</item>

        <item>Banana Aphids</item>
        <item>Pentalonia nigronervosa</item>
        <item>Like most aphids, the banana aphid is a phloem feeder that uses its long stylets to pierce plant tissues to suck the sap directly from the vessels. This can cause plants to become deformed; the leaves become curled and shriveled, and in some cases galls are formed on the leaves. Nymphs: Like most other aphid species, the banana aphid has four nymphal stages. Newborn nymphs are oval at first and become slightly elongated. They are reddish brown, with four segmented antennae, and measure 1/250 inch in length. The second stage nymphs are similar in appearance and measure approximately 7/250 inch long. The third nymphal stage individuals are light brown, measuring about 9/250 inch in length; the compound eyes are more noticeable beginning with this stage, and the nymphs have five-segmented antennae. The fourth stage nymphs have six-segmented antennae, are light brown in color, and are 1/25 inch long. The first, second, third, and fourth nymphal stages last 2 to 4, 3 to 4, 2 to 4, and 2 to 4 days, respectively. Adults: Adult banana aphids are small to medium sized aphids (1/25 to 1/12 inch), shiny, reddish to dark brown or almost black. They have six-segmented antennae that are as long as the body. Alates have prominent, dark (brown or black) wing veins. Adults start producing young one day after reaching maturity. They can give birth to 4 aphids per day with an average production of 14 offspring per female.</item>
        <item>Aphids can be killed by their natural enemies, or with sprays of registered insecticides, or with insecticidal soaps or liquid dish washing detergents and vegetable oils. Ants protect the aphids from their enemies, and ants feed upon the sweet honeydew that aphids produce. Control tips: (1) Inspect alternate hosts for aphids - eliminate populations of banana aphids that are living on non-banana hosts within the vicinity of your bananas; (2) Inspect banana plants for aphids - scout banana plants at least twice per month for aphid colonies; (3) Control ants - control ants if possible and lawful, ants aggressively protect aphids from natural enemies; (4) Invite beneficial animals and insects - strive to foster a conducive environment for beneficial, aphid-feeding or -parasitizing insects such as lady beetles; (5) Destroy wild bananas in the area - eliminate wild of unattended patches of bananas, large populations of banana aphids can grow on them and the wild patches when infected can serve as a serious and constant source of disease for farms and residential neighborhoods; (6) Control weeds around bananas - maintain good weed control around the banana patch; (7) Diversify the banana farm - grow a range of different plants or crops; (8) Prune the mats - keep banana mats pruned of all unwanted suckers; (9) Spray for aphid control.</item>

        <item>Leaves have abnormal colours, abnormal leaf fall, internal feeding, necrotic areas, and wilting. Adult lace bugs have beautifully sculptured wings that resemble an intricate, lacy network. There are also lacy extensions at each side on the front part of the body and an expanded, lacy hood that extends over the head. Some species are almost entirely white while others are marked with black or brown. They range in size from 1/8 to 3/16 inch. Nymphs do not have wings but usually have spines on the back.</item>
        <item>To manage lace bugs, remove leaflets harboring the insects and destroy them. For chemical method, spraying one these can help: Malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/lt, Dimethoate 30 EC @1 ml/lt, Methyl demeton 25 EC @1 ml/lt, Phosphamidon 40 SL @1.25 ml/lt, Monocrotophos 36 WSC @1 ml/lt, Methomyl 25 EC @2 ml/lit, 3% Neem oil.</item>

        <item>Chrysomphalus aonidium Hemiberlesia lataneae</item>
        <item>Whether armored or soft, scale insects are often found on the undersides of leaves or on branches. Each species of scale has specific plants they are associated with. The scale blends in well, so the actual insect may not be very apparent. When scales feed underneath the leaves, yellow spots often appear on the tops of the foliage. Over time, the plant can become more chlorotic-looking, and new plant growth can be stunted. And if you’re dealing with soft scale, another symptom is the appearance of sooty mold. (Be aware, however, that sooty mold can also be caused by whiteflies and aphids.) Scale insects vary dramatically in appearance; from very small organisms (1–2 mm) that grow beneath wax covers (some shaped like oyster shells, others like mussel shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. Adult female scales are almost always immobile (aside from mealybugs) and permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized. They secrete a waxycoating for defense; this coating causes them to resemble reptilian scales or fish scales, hence their common name.</item>
        <item>To get rid of scale insects prune and dispose of infested branches, twigs and leaves. When scale numbers are low they may be rubbed or picked off of plants by hand. Dabbing individual pests with an alcohol-soaked cotton swab or neem-based leaf shine will also work when infestations are light. Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewing, are natural predators of the young larval or “crawler” stage. Organic pesticides, like insecticidal soap and d-Limonene can also be used to kill the larvae. However, these products have very little persistence in the environment, so several applications during egg-hatching will be required for effective control. Azamax contains azadirachtin, the key insecticidal ingredient found in neem oil. This concentrated spray is approved for organic use and offers multiple modes of action, making it virtually impossible for pest resistance to develop. Best of all, it’s non-toxic to honey bees and many other beneficial insects. Horticultural oils and other safe, oil-based insecticides work by smothering insects and will control all pest stages, including adults which are protected from most other insecticides by their armor coverings. Fast-acting botanical insecticides should be used as a last resort. Derived from plants which have insecticidal properties, these natural pesticides have fewer harmful side effects than synthetic chemicals and break down more quickly in the environment.</item>

        <item>Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. All predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and then prey extensively on eggs and larvae. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera are known to parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include aphid wasps, anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. For this reason, many growers are occasionally forced to make limited use of pesticides to control thrips populations in the field and in greenhouses. Another effective strategy for pest thrips are biological insecticides, including Beauveria bassiana or Verticillium lecanii. These demonstrate a clear effect on eggs, larvae and adults of thrips. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thripes occur when plants are illuminated with red light.</item>

        <item>Conopomorpha cramerella</item>
        <item>External damage to the pod caused by the cocoa pod borer is seen as entry and exit holes created by the tunnelling larvae on the husk, and overall premature or uneven ripening (yellowing) of pods caused by internal feeding activity. If pods are cut open, characteristic tunnels and scarification caused by feeding commonly cause beans to stick together. Harvested beans clump together in severe infestations and may be impossible to extract from damaged pods. Adult: The adult is a small brown moth, ca 7 mm in length. It has a wingspan of about 12 mm characterized by bright yellow patches at the tips of the forewings. The moths have very long antennae which are swept backwards in their natural resting position. Moths in flight have an appearance similar to that of large, slow-flying mosquitoes. Eggs: Eggs are yellow-orange, flattened and just visible to the naked eye (ca 0.5 x 0.2 mm). Rectangular indentations cover the surface of the egg. On hatching, eggs become translucent, the shell being whitish but darkened by faeces within. Larva: First-instar larvae are translucent white in colour and ca 1 mm long. Late-instar larvae are ca 10 mm long and creamy coloured while still inside the pod, but greenish after they emerge to pupate. Pupa: Pupae lie beneath a light-brown waterproof silken membrane tightly drawn over a depression on a pod surface or leaf.</item>
        <item>Harvesting: Rampasan; Mechanical control: Sleeving; Integrated Pest Management: The most immediate reductions in C. cramerella are likely to come about through better managed harvesting and spraying. Both of these rely on well-pruned trees kept to a height low enough to collect and/or spray all pods. See sections on Harvesting (Rampasan) and Chemical Control. Longer term control may be improved by grafting or replanting with hard-walled clones. Further releases of exotic natural enemies may provide additional partial control, if suitable parasites can be found.</item>

        <item>Growing point: distortion; Inflorescence: twisting and distortion; Leaves: abnormal forms, leaves rolled or folded. Eggs are not produced by this species. Females give birth to living young. There are four nymphal stages of this aphid. The first stage is approximately 1/36 inch in length and the last about 1/17 inch. They are without wings and brownish in color. Only females are found. They are oval, shiny black, brownish-black or reddish brown in color, either with or without wings, measuring 1/25 to 1/12 inch in body length and having short black-and-white banded antennae. Winged individuals tend to have darker abdomens and be slightly thinner. The incidence of winged individuals is dependent on the population density and leaf age. Reproduction is partheneogenic or non sexual. Females start reproducing soon after becoming adults. They produce 5 to 7 live young per day, up to a total of about 50 young per female.</item>
        <item>Non-Chemical Control: Several natural enemies of the black citrus aphid keep this pest under control. Sometimes to the extent that insecticides are usually unnecessary; Chemical Control: If chemical control becomes necessary either insecticidal oil, or a synthetic aphidicide(insecticide) may be used. Chemical control should only be applied at the first signs of damage during periods of flush growth. Flush growth (young red leaves) on coffee should be completely moistened after application of chemicals.</item>

Dead scales are light brown or buff color and the black internal marking is lost. Nymphs: Nymphs, or immature green scales are oval, flat and yellowish green in color, and have six short legs. There are three nymphal stages before becoming an adult, each stage being larger and more convex than the previous stage. Eggs: Eggs are whitish green and elongate-oval and are laid singly and hatch beneath the female where they are protected. Eggs hatch from a few minutes to several hours after being laid.</item>
        <item>Chemical control: Direct insecticidal sprays to lower leaf surfaces and new growth to give thorough coverage; Biological control: Several entomogenous fungi were observed associated with green scale on citrus, and some apparently played an important role in the natural limitations of the scale on citrus during certain seasons of the year. In Florida, these fungi include: the white-fringed fungus, Verticilium (Cephalosporium ) lecanii (Zimmerman); Aschersonia cubensis (Cuban aschersonia); the pink scale fungus, Nectria diploa; and a grayish blue fungus The white-fringed fungus is the most common and apparently causes the highest percentage of mortality. All attempts to artificially spread or inoculate the fungus to healthy green scale were unsuccessful. The green scale is often associated with ants. Controlling ant populations help to reduce levels of this pest. Ants protect the green scales from lady beetles and other predators. In turn, the ants feed on the sweet honeydew excreted by the scales. Without the ants the green scale is more vulnerable to predation by beetles; Cultural Control: Scales are usually brought into greenhouse situations with the introduction of infested plant material. All plant material going into the greenhouse should be thoroughly inspected for scales and other insects before being introduced.</item>

        <item>Brontispa longissima</item>
        <item>Both adults and larvae damage the leaflets of young unopened fronds. They graze away the leaf surface in streaks, which are typically parallel to the midrib. The narrow feeding scars enlarge to form irregular, brown blotches as the frond opens. The brown areas shrivel and curl, giving the leaf a characteristic scorched, ragged appearance. Large areas of the leaflets break off leaving the foliage partially skeletonized and its effective photosynthetic tissue may in extreme cases be reduced to virtually nothing. As the leaflets separate when the fronds expand, the adults move to attack younger leaves. They leave narrow chewing marks, which are individually less damaging than larval feeding. Adults cause more damage than larvae due to the longer duration of this stage. The shorter interval between the opening of successive fronds on mature palms, and their larger size, contribute greatly to their relative freedom from attack. A mature palm may be expected to produce a new frond every 4-5 weeks. In young palms, after the rapid emergence of the first few seedling leaves, the fronds are produced less frequently and over the first 4-5 years of its life a young palm will, on average, produce a new frond only once in every 6-7 weeks; under adverse conditions the interval may exceed 8 weeks. Thus, on a young palm there is never more than one frond vulnerable to attack at any one time, and there is usually an interval between the opening of consecutive fronds when there is not one at a vulnerable stage. This results in all immigrant beetles becoming concentrated on those palms which do have a vulnerable frond, and the relatively small size of the fronds renders the damage more devastating. The fronds are larger in mature palms and there may be more than one infested frond at any one time; so that, although the number of beetles may be greater, there is less damage. The rate of frond production gradually speeds up after the palm is about 5 years old, and, by the time it is 8-10 years old, the palm will be producing new fronds at the normal interval of one every 4-5 weeks. It is significant that, at this age, healthy, vigorous palms achieve relative immunity to severe beetle attack. Eggs: The brown eggs are elliptical, about 1.5 mm long and 1 mm wide, with each end broadly rounded. The slightly convex upper surface has the chorion with a honeycomb sculpturation. They are fixed to the leaf surface by a cementing substance. Larva: The larvae are whitish in colour. The head of the first stage larva is comparatively large compared with the body. The entire cuticle is more densely covered with minute spicules. A seta arises from about the middle of the lateral margin of each thoracic segment, with two setae on each of the abdominal lateral processes. Each process of the tail-shovel bears a large, sharp, curved spine at the inner angle, and a series of five or six setae along the dorsal and ventral margins. The larva is about the same length as the egg, but about 0.75 mm in width. The second-instar larva resembles the full-grown larva more than the first instar. The lateral abdominal processes are longer, each bearing four setae which are comparatively longer than those of the fully developed larva and situated at different points around the periphery of the apex. There are eight setae on the prothorax (four on each side) and six on the meso- and metathorax (three on each side, two setae on the produced part and one posteriorly). The distinct spine at the inner angle of each prong of the tail-shovel is not prominent as in the first-instar. The fully developed larva has the body moderately flat, almost parallel-sided, very slightly and gradually narrowed from the prothorax towards the apex, composed of 13 segments (one head, three thoracic and nine abdominal). It is almost 9 mm long and 2.25 mm wide. The anus is situated ventrally on the ninth segment, if the fold at the anal orifice is considered as representing a segment, then the abdomen should be regarded as 10-segmented. The distinct head bears a pair of 2-segmented antennae; a group of five ocelli, three in a line and two in another, situated behind the antennae; a pair of apically bidentate mandibles. The thoracic segments are broader than they are long, the mesothorax very slightly broader than the prothorax and the metathorax very slightly broader than the mesothorax. The dorsal surface of the prothorax is more strongly sclerotized with a fine median suture and laterally rounded. The meso- and metathorax bears laterally a small knob in the middle, bearing two fine, short setae. There is a pair of well developed 3-segmented legs on each thoracic segment, each terminating in a single claw and fleshy pad-like structure. Each of the first seven abdominal segments is broader than it is long; each of the first three segments is somewhat shorter than the following segments; the eighth and ninth together form the terminal tail-shovel. Each segment bears laterally a moderately long process, ventral to the spiracles. A lateral process is a conical structure projecting horizontally nearly from the middle of the margin, except in the fifth, sixth and seventh segments, in which they appear to arise more from the posterior part. The apical part is subconical and distinctly thinner than the basal part. The entire surface is densely covered with spinules. The apical part bearing three or four setae. The tail-shovel is longer than broad, apically deeply concave, the prongs bent inwards and bluntly-pointed. The upper ridge on each side bearing nine spinules, three smaller on the basal part nearer the large spiracle, four larger on the middle part and two smaller on the bent apical part. There are 4 small spinules on the lower ridge more widely spaced than those on the upper ridge. The upper surface is concave, bearing many irregularly placed transparent areas and the ventral surface is flat. There are 9 pairs of spiracles, one thoracic, between the pro- and mesothorax, situated on a conical structure resembling a lateral process, and one pair dorsally situated on each of the first seven abdominal segments. The larvae undergo five instars which can be distinguished on the morphometrics ( in mm) of the tail-shovel as follows: L1, 0.33, mean 0.13; L2, 0.47, mean 0.20; L3, 0.65, mean 0.29; L4, 0.82, mean 0.37; L5, 0.94, mean 0.45. Pupa: The head bears three processes, one median and one on each side. Each lateral process is fleshy, broadest basally, pointed apically, pre-apically bearing small blunt spine. Thorax with meso- and metanotum each bearing a pair of wings. The abdomen is 9-segmented, the eighth and ninth segments are fused. Each of the first six segments bears laterally a pair of spiracles opening dorsally. Each segment bearing spinules arranged as follows: no spinules on first segment; from segments 2 to 7, two groups of four in transverse line, one nearer the basal margin and the other nearer the apical, those of the basal group are comparatively larger and more widely-spaced, those of the apical line are situated in the intervals of the spinules of the basal group; on segment 8 only two in transverse line near the basal margin. Dorso-laterally bearing a longitudinal series of spinules, one on each of the first seven segments, situated a little posterior to and more inward than the corresponding spiracle (on the seventh in a similar position). Anterior to each spiracle on segments 3 to 6 and in a similar position on 7 is a spine. Laterally on segments 1-7 bearing a group of closely placed spinules bearing moderately long setae, the spinules being less prominent on segments 1-2, or 3. Ventrally, only segments 4-7 bearing spinules. The prongs of the tail-shovel are more slender, somewhat longer than those of the larva, and also lack lateral spines or setae. The last larval exuvium is always retained on the prongs of the tail-shovel. Adult: The adults 8.5-9.5 mm long, 2.00-2.25 mm wide; length of antenna, 2.75 mm. The males are slightly smaller than females. Their colour varies geographically from reddish-brown in Java, to almost black in the Solomon Islands and Irian Jaya. Some specimens have the elytra brown or black, or have a spindle-shaped black marking on the elytral suture. Considerable overlapping of these forms, which were long regarded as distinct species, occurs.</item>
        <item>Cultural control: A surgical method of control has been attempted in the Solomon Islands; this involved cutting out and destroying the central unopened frond which harbours the pest. This procedure must be conducted over a large area at one time to reduce re-infestation from neighbouring palms and must be repeated fairly often to be effective. Palms which were 3-6 years old could stand the loss of one leaf every 6 months, but younger palms could not as this caused too great a reduction in growth rate. However, this method is expensive and will not greatly affect the Brontispa population as a whole unless mature palms are also treated. Mechanical control of the pest by removing affected heart leaves is laborious and has very little effect. Chemical control: Chemicals used to control the pest must reach the insect in the narrow crevices between the leaflets and chemical treatment must be maintained throughout the year because B. longissima breeds continuously, with several generations a year. If beetles start breeding as soon as they reach the young palms, larvae will probably start appearing after about 1 week; if there has been any residual effect from insecticide treatment, or if the invasion rate is slow, it will be considerably longer before the larval population presents a serious risk. The application of chemicals at 10-day intervals was more effective than 3-weekly applications. Frequent applications of high volumes of spray, in excess of that required to provide satisfactory levels of control, caused slight phytotoxicity; growth and the production of new fronds was retarded. Satisfactory control can be achieved at low cost using a fine, low-volume spray applied from above to the central spike of each individual palm. Damage caused by Brontispa is considered serious enough for chemical control measures to be used on young palms. Chemicals recommended are carbaryl and trichlorfon. The pesticide is applied to the central spike of the palm. Trichlorfon eliminated Brontispa from isolated areas of young palms in Western Samoa. Monthly spraying of young coconuts with permethrin is also advocated in Western Samoa.</item>

        <item>Coconut Scale Insect</item>
        <item>Aspidiotus destructor, Aspidiotus rigidus</item>
        <item>On leaves, A. destructor causes yellow spots to develop beneath the insects, due to the toxicity of saliva injected in to plant tissues while feeding. Entire leaves may turn yellow to brown and fall, and fruits may be discoloured, stunted or fall prematurely. The bright yellow colour of affected coconut palms is clearly visible from a great distance. The undersurface of the leaves is mainly attacked, but frond stalks, flower clusters and young fruit can also be affected. In extreme cases, the leaves dry out, entire fronds drop off and the crown dies. Coconut scale resembles other armored scales in that the body is protected by a waxy cover. Infestations may be noted by the formation of closely packed colonies composed of what resemble miniature fried eggs. Females develop through two nymphal stages, while males have an additional non-feeding pre-pupal stage (four immature stages). Positive identification of coconut scales requires that adult females be slide mounted and the diagnostic characters observed at high magnification. Eggs: Freshly laid eggs are smooth, elongate and whitish, becoming pale yellow over time. Eggs are laid under the scale cover around the body of the female. Mean length and width of eggs are 0.22 mm and 0.09 mm, respectively. First instar nymphs: Newly hatched nymphs (also called crawlers) are free-moving and recognized by the presence of legs, antennae, and a pair of bristles at the tip of abdomen. Crawlers are light green to yellowish brown, translucent and somewhat oblong, with an average length and width of 0.23 mm and 0.11 mm, respectively. Second instar female: Females remain pale yellow, circular and somewhat transparent in the second instar, which lasts for 8-10 days. Females nymphs are 0.6-1.1 mm long. Male nymphs: Development of male characteristics starts in the middle of the second instar. Male covers become reddish brown and more elliptical in shape, and then transform in stages into the pre-pupal, pupal and adult stages. The second instar lasts for 5-8 days for males. The male pre-pupal and pupal stages are spent under the scale produced by the second instar. Adult females: Adult female coconut scales have a circular or broadly oval cover that is 1.5-2.0 mm in diameter. The cover is flat and translucent with a subcentral pale exuviae. Bodies of slide-mounted specimens are 0.7-1.2 mm in length with a pyriform and membranous body. Diagnostic characteristics include: three pairs of lobes with no indication of a fourth pair; plates long, flat and fringed; and with sclerotization on the dorsum of the pygidium. Adult males: Adult male coconut scales are small, two-winged, reddish, gnat-like insects with eyes, antennae, three pairs of legs and long appendages. Adult males do not feed and are short lived.</item>
        <item>Biological Control: Over 40 species of parasitoids and predators, and several fungal pathogens, are known to attack coconut scale. In the absence of these natural enemies, population explosions of this pest can occur. Aphytis melinus DeBach and Aphytis lingnanensis Compere (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) are the most common parasitoid species controlling the coconut scale populations in Fiji and the Philippines. Aphytis melinus and/or another parasitoid, Comperiella bifasciata Howard (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), were introduced into Hawaii, California, Argentina and other regions for the control of coconut scale. Cultural control: Pruning and training of fruit trees and proper disposal of infested leaves, branches and twigs will help control scale insects on nursery plants and trees. Excessive use of plant fertilizers contributes to scale outbreaks. Chemical control: Various insecticides are registered for control of armored scales in ornamental and fruit crops. Crawler stages are generally the most susceptible to insecticides. Contact action insecticides, including horticultural oils, become progressively less effective once the scale insects develop their waxy cover. Insect growth regulators may be effective, provided they are applied when the immature stages are present. Location of the insect on the plant, growth stage of the plant, and solubility of the insecticide influence the effectiveness of systemic insecticides applied for control of armored scales. Several spray applications at 15-20 day intervals may be necessary for complete management of a heavy infestation. The toxicity of insecticides to parasitoids and other beneficial insects should be considered before starting a spray program for scale insects. Since coconut scale is a quarantine pest in many areas, phytosanitary treatment with gamma irradiation has been developed as a potential control measure for this scale.</item>

Immature specimens are reddish and adults are rufous amber. The body shape from above is ovate-sagittate with the width approximately 2/3 that of the length. The dorsal cuticular surface of the body is conspicuously reticulated. The areolae on cephalothorax laterad of the mandibular plate is about 1/3 longer than wide. Dorsally, the cephalothorax bears three pairs of rather weak setae; one pair at the anterior margin between coxae one, one pair just in front of the eyes, and one pair just behind the eyes. The abdomen bears 20 very weak setae dorsally: seven along each lateral margin from the main suture back to the caudal tip; three submedian pairs, the first near the main suture and the second and third pairs opposite the second and third marginal setae, respectively. All dorsal setae appear to be simple, unpectinate, and unserrate. A pair of dusky-bordered pores opens dorsally on the abdomen, a short distance behind the main suture. The legs are short and stout, and the posterior pair barely reaches beyond the tip of the abdomen.</item>

        <item>Oryctes rhinoceros</item>
        <item>O. rhinoceros adults feed in the crown region of both coconut and oil palm. On oil palms they bore through petiole bases into the central unopened leaves. This causes tissue maceration and the presence of a fibrous frass inside and at the entrance to the feeding hole is an indication of its activity within. A single attack may be followed by others on the same palm. These attacks subsequently produce fronds which have wedge-shaped gaps or the characteristic V-shaped cuts to fronds. Although Oryctes rhinoceros is found in several regions of the world, its shape, size and color are generally consistent. Adult beetles range from 1.2 to 2.5 inches in length (3.0 to 6.3 cm) and are dark brown or black. The ventral surface (underside) of males and females has reddish-brown hairs, but the female has a fuzzy grouping of these hairs at the tip of the abdomen. Both males and females possess a similarly sized horn used for leverage when moving within tightly-packed leaves or within the cavities they create in the crown of palms, the horn length is longer on average for males. Oryctes rhinoceros larvae (grubs) are milky white with red heads. The body is C-shaped, has three pairs of segmented legs, and is grayish posteriorly. Over the course of three instars, or phases between molts, they grow to 4.0 inches long (10.0 cm).</item>
        <item>Detection can be difficult due to the beetle’s nocturnal activity and residence within trees. Visual signs such as holes bored at the base of leaves and V-shaped feeding damage help locate this beetle. Once detected, management and control are required to mitigate the economic impact of a beetle infestation. Control: Historical control of scarab beetle pests has included chemical and biopesticides, biological control (predators, parasitoids, and pathogens), and trapping with lures. Traps for the coconut rhinoceros beetle contain 4-methyloctanoate, an aggregation pheromone produced by the male beetle. In breeding sites, the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae may be applied for larval control and is distributed by adults. This fungus acts as a biopesticide on immature stages of the beetle. Viruses in the genus Nudivirus have also been associated with Oryctes rhinoceros and may play a role in controlling the beetle in regions where they are invasive. Infection by Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirusdeforms and may kill larvae, and hinders oviposition by females. However, the nudivirus may harm other species and genera of scarabs. In Korea, farmers of Allomyrina dichotoma (Japanese rhinoceros beetle) face a potential disaster if the nudivirus were to infect their populations, which consist of hundreds of larvae grown together in large plastic containers. These beetles are cultivated for sale as pets and to be used in gambling. The result of a Korean study in which Allomyrina dichotoma larvae were infected with the nudivirus was that 60% died in six weeks. There is also concern that the nudivirus may be transmitted to wild populations of Allomyrina dichotoma. There is no clear indication that the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus is the major pathogen responsible for losses of Allomyrina dichotoma in Korea and tests are ongoing. Management: Managing the coconut rhinoceros beetle involves removing or destroying organic material that supports larval development such as decaying logs and stumps, removing dead palms, and removing piles of leaves and grass. A study on burning the downed and decomposing trunks of oil palms has shown that only partial burning of sites is ineffective in managing population levels of Oryctes rhinoceros.</item>

Regions adjoining the healthy part has a water-soaked appearance. Lesions may start at one or both edges of the leaves and as the disease advances, the lesions cover the entire blade, turn grayish, and later white. Appearance of milky or ”opaque dew drops” on the surface of young lesions in the morning is a sign of bacterial blight infection. The milky dew drops dry to form small, amber-colored beads and these spheres are the ooze of the bacterial mass. Infection at seedling stage develop “Kresek” or wilting of whole leaves or the entire plant. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.</item>

        <item>Surfaces of leaf blades, leaf sheaths and stalks exhibit brown, circular, powdery pustules. Leaves which are severely infected dries up and defoliates prematurely. Those of southern rust are circular to oval, light cinnamon-brown to orange in color and predominantly on the upper-leaf surface. Pustules tend to occur only sparsely on the leaf underside, but may occur abundantly on the leaf sheath. Haloes can be observed in some hybrids around pustules when leaves are backlit. The pustules are usually more densely clustered than those of common rust. And, like common rust, the pustules can darken in color later in the season as the spore type changes. Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of the rust fungus. Sweet corn is generally more susceptible than field corn. In years with exceptionally cool summers, and especially on late-planted fields or sweet corn, yield losses may occur when the leaves at and above the ears become severely diseased before grain fill is complete.</item>

        <item>Symptoms vary depending on the strain of the virus, the variety of banana or plantain and the environment. The most common symptom is lines of yellow that run from the midrib of the leaf to the margin. These streaks are continuous or broken, and either scattered throughout the leaf or in bands. As the leaf ages, the streaks turn brown or black. Initially, the symptoms are similar to Cucumber mosaic virus.Infected plants may be smaller than normal and less vigorous, with smaller bunches. In some African countries, dieback and internal rotting of the pseudostem occurs. Differences between symptoms in different parts of the world led to them being described as distinct viruses. Molecular studies on the DNA of the viruses have confirmed the differences. Spread of the virus is in planting material, suckers primarily. Spread can also occur as plants in tissue culture if they are not tested properly. It is now known that the virus or parts of the virus can enter the DNA of certain varieties (e.g., AAB, ABB, AAAB types) and remain hidden there without showing symptoms. However, if bananas are grown under stress, such as occurs when they are growing as tissue cultures, the virus reassembles, multiplies, and symptoms appear. Spread between plants is by mealybugs, especially species of Planococcus and Pseudococcus, although how important they are is not well known.</item>

        <item>Banana bunchy top nanavirus</item>
        <item>Plants with banana bunchy top (BBT) have narrow, progressively shorter leaves with little distance between them, hence the name "bunchy top". Leaf edges often roll upwards with yellow margins. The most characteristic symptoms are short, dark-green dots and dashes along the minor leaf veins, so-called "Morse-code" patterns, which form hooks curving downwards near the edge of the midrib. Hold the leaf up to the light and view from the underside. The virus is spread by an aphid, Pentalonia nigronervosa. It takes more than 4 hours of feeding on a diseased plant before aphids become infected with the virus. But once infected, the aphids continue spreading the virus until they die. Aphids live for 15-20 days. The virus is not transmitted on tools or through the soil. BBT is caused by a virus. In the past, the disease has devastated banana industries in Australia, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Today, it is causing much damage in Pakistan and is spreading in the DR Congo. Plants that are infected when young rarely produce a fruit bunch. When diseased suckers are planted they become severely stunted and they do not produce fruit. Plants infected at a later growth stage may produce a distorted bunch. In Pacific island countries, the failure to select healthy planting material has resulted in plantations showing 20% of plants with BBT in the first year, and major losses within 2-3 years.</item>
        <item>Banana plants should only be transferred between countries as tissue cultures tested to ensure that they are free of all known banana viruses.

        <item>Cultural control: Several cultural practices to manage black pod disease could be implemented in cocoa plantation. A spacing of 3.1 x 3.1m and pruning of trees are recommended for cocoa planting in order to allow more light and air flow around the trees. This will reduce the level of humidity that is causing black pod disease. The removal of pods with black pod symptom should also be done in favor to eliminate the source of inoculum. In another study, the utilization of litter mulch under cocoa plantation has been reported in Papua New Guinea, which has some negative effect on the population of P. palmivora, and therefore could reduce the pod infection especially at the beginning of raining season. Leaf litter showed rapid decline in pathogen recovery of colonized cocoa tissue after 18 weeks, relative to grass ground cover. More frequent ripe pod harvest (i.e. twice a week) and removal of infected pod on the ground was demonstrated to significantly reduced disease occurrence and improve pod yield compared to less frequent harvest and removal (i.e. once a month). In addition, scattered healthy pod on the ground should also be removed, as it will be infected and become the source of inoculum later. Sanitation is one cultural method to control for black pod disease. Sanitation practices include weed removal, pruning, thinning and removal of infected and mummified pods every two weeks in order to eliminate the source for inoculum. Phytosanitary pod removal was observed to significantly reduce disease occurrences by 9–11% to 22–31%, where this practice removes the source for secondary inoculum. However, increase in disease incidence after raining season was observed to be most likely due to the spread of inoculum from survival site by the rain. The application of fungicide following sanitation is commonly performed for an effective control of disease, as sanitation practice alone would not completely eliminate the source of inoculum and still causes greater black pod incident compared to sanitation followed by at least one fungicide application; Chemical control: The application of copper fungicide has been shown to significantly reduce a great number of black pod incidences in Nigeria. Metalaxyl (Ridomil) and cuprous oxide (Perenox) were identified to be successful in increasing the number of harvested healthy pod compared to the application of fosetyl aluminium (Aliete) and control treatment. On top of that, the timing of fungicide application has some positive effect on the final pod yield where this plot produced greater yield than the unsprayed plot. The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October. The recommended standard for fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation with one or two fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application. It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management; Cultural and chemical control: In Ghana, a study that combined the sanitation and fungicide application showed a significant reduction in the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment; Biological control: Heavy application of chemical fungicide would eventually leads to resistant of pathogen and causing soil and water pollutions. Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus has the potential to reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms cause by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides; Resistant variety: There is no specific variety of cocoa that shows resistant to Phytophthora infections and the establishment and utilization of resistant variety will be most likely depends on the region. Numerous breeding programs have been established worldwide in order to screen and test for local hybrids for disease resistant of Phytophthora spp. For example, a study in Cameroon assessed the performance of local cocoa cultivars (the southern and northern Cameroon cultivar) compared to the local and international gene bank cultivars. The local genebank cultivar consisted of F1 hybrid of Upper Amazon X Trinidad, and an international cultivar from Papua New Guinea, and Latin America were provided through International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad. Based on the information provided by farmers and leaf disc test to assess resistant variety, the local cultivars selected from farmers field showed some resistant to P. megakarya compared to other varieties. Thus, it was concluded that there are some potential resistant varieties available in this area.</item>

        <item>Leaves: abnormal colors, abnormal leaf fall, necrotic areas; Roots: necreotic streaks or lesions; Stems: dieback, discoloration of bark, internal discoloration, mould growth on lesion; Whole plant: dwarfing. Infection always occurs through young flush leaves at a growing point with the fungus growing down the stem. Seedlings have only one growing point and are killed by the infection. After the jorquette is formed, the infection may progress into the main stem and kill the plant. Once trees are mature they have thousands of growing points, all of which can be infected. The disease does not progress into the larger branches of mature trees except perhaps in the most susceptible material, within which it can spread to the trunk causing the tree to die. There are no visible symptoms during initial fungal growth within the plant.</item>
        <item>Monthly inspection and pruning of infected stems has been practised both to prevent the disease from spreading within individual plants and also to lower the inoculum level. Pruning can be effective when combined with moderate levels of resistance, but it was often ineffective when inoculum levels were high and planting material was susceptible. Pruning young seedlings can result in complete recovery, but may also lead to an uneven stand.</item>

        <item>Brown Eye Spot</item>
        <item>Mycosphaerella coffeicola</item>
        <item>Spots occur on leaves and berries. Plants are susceptible throughout all of their developmental stages. Brown circular leaf spots, up to 15 mm in diam., sometimes with concentric rings and a yellowish halo. The centre of spot becomes grey and dark sporulation can be seen in this area.</item>
        <item>Prevention is the most effective method of managing M. coffeicola. Risk factors for this pathogen include: prolonged (24–72 hours) humid environment, poor soil nutrition, and plant stress caused by increased planting density, herbicide injury, weeds, drought, and over irrigation. To manage humidity a farmer can prune to allow for air circulation and ensure the soil has proper drainage. In order to maintain proper plant nutrition, soil testing and a fertilization regiment are essential for combating this pathogen. Plant symptoms such as chlorosis, leaf curling, and bronzing along the edges of leaves can be used to diagnose specific nutrient deficiencies. For example if a plant has leaves bronzed along edges, cupped down-ward; new leaves dead; eventual die back of shoot tips, then it is likely the plant has a calcium deficiency. To reduce plant stress, a farmer can use herbicides to combat weeds but must be careful not to damage the plant in process. Also to minimize competition between adjacent crops, it is important to properly space coffee plants in 8 ft. by 8 ft. areas. Stress can further be minimized if post and pre-harvest damage by machinery or laborers is avoided. To avoid wilting stress plants should be properly irrigated. However, if a crop already has M. coffeicola, copper fungicide is effective. In Hawaii, farmers often spray tri-annually, using 1.5-6 lbs of fungicide per 50–100 gallons water, containing 30-80% copper hydroxide. "Sprays should coincide with dry weather and calm winds. Three spray applications per season should suffice (occurring approximately once per month), beginning at flowering. Thorough coverage of the plant canopy is very important. Large farms in Hawai‘i utilize tractor-mounted mist blowers."</item>

        <item>Hemileia vastatrix</item>
        <item>Infections occur on the coffee leaves.The first observable symptoms are small, pale yellow spots on the upper surfaces of the leaves. As these spots gradually increase in diameter, masses of orange urediniospores (= uredospores) appear on the undersurfaces. The fungus sporulates through the stomata rather than breaking through the epidermis as most rusts do, so it does not form the pustules typical of many rusts. The powdery lesions on the undersides of the leaves can be orange-yellow to red-orange in color, and there is considerable variation from one region to another. While the lesions can develop anywhere on the leaf, they tend to be concentrated around the margins, where dew and rain droplets collect. The centers of the spots eventually dry and turn brown, while the margins of the lesions continue to expand and produce urediniospores. Early in the season, the first lesions usually appear on the lowermost leaves, and the infection slowly progresses upward in the tree. The infected leaves drop prematurely, leaving long expanses of twigs devoid of leaves. The disease is recognized by the yellow-orange powdery lesions or spots on the underside of leaves</item>
        <item>Non-chemical control: Resistance varies with leaf age, particularly for susceptible varieties, with young leaves more susceptible than older leaves on the same plant. Plants with incomplete resistance, however, usually display the opposite response,with high resistance in young and low resistance in older leaves. Cultivars derived from Timor hybrid and the Icatu cultivar display this pattern. Light intensity also influences cultivar reactions. Leaves exposed to high light intensity are generally more susceptible to rust, varying up to 10 fold depending upon pre- and post-inoculation light intensity. It is an important consideration in setting up conditions for rust screening or evaluation. Overbearing coffee may exacerbate rust intensity. Additionally, leaves supporting rapidly growing coffee berries are more susceptible to infection than leaves that only support vegetative growth. High yielding coffee varieties are more susceptible than low yielding varieties. Chemical control: Fungicides to control of rust have been used successfully for a quite a number of years. The metallic copper fungicides have been the least expensive and most effective, with copper oxychloride formulations being the best. The dithiocarbamate protectant fungicides have been useful, but their short residual life and instability at higher temperatures and humidity have limited their widespread adoption. Their performance is better when mixed with copper fungicides. The systemic triazole sterol biosynthesis inhibitors have been effective, but high cost and occasional problems with severe defoliation (phytotoxicity) have been observed. Among the systemics, triademifon has been the best so far. The systemics have also been particularly effective when used in combination or alternately with copper fungicides, reducing the likelihood for the development of fungicide tolerant rust strains. Occasional problems with defoliation associated with the systemics, and their high cost, however, may limit their usefulness. Fungicide efficacy depends both on timing of application and complete placement or coverage of the toxicant. This latter factor is important, since redistribution by rain is very limited. Important factors are spray volume, droplet size, and coverage. In timing the application of fungicides, rainfall was generally the most important factor to consider. Sprays during the rainy season were recommended, and sometimes recommended before the onset of the rainy season. Studies showed that initial inoculum level and berry yield varied greatly from year to year, and it was necessary to include these factors in scheduling fungicide applications. Yield in coffee can vary from maximum to 10 percent of max yield, depending on cultivar and on the extent of defoliation and yield the previous year, due to rust. Only 2-3 fungicide applications were required during low yield years and 4-6 applications during high yield years. These schedules were developed empirically.</item>

        <item>Initial symptoms vary with the host. On Hevea, the initial stages of infection are seen as drops of latex and a silky-white mycelial growth on the surface of brown bark. In Piper, sterile pink/white pustules of around 1 mm diameter appear on the young green stems. In Citrus, the sterile pustules may appear first, sometimes with gummosis. In Theobroma, infection is usually first seen as a sparse white mycelium (web) on the bark surface. The surface mycelium is easily overlooked, particularly where the bark is wet. The mycelium spreads mainly along the underside of the branch and sterile pink/white mycelial pustules appear through cracks in the bark and through the pores of the swollen lenticels, about 1-8 cm behind the leading edge of the infection. Hyphae penetrate the branch, causing progressive death of distal tissues. Leaves distal to the infection turn light green in the interveinal areas and then scorch brown from the margins. The affected leaves remain attached to the plant for a long time, giving an appearance similar to that of a broken branch. The characteristic pink/white or pink/orange basidiomatal encrustation develops mostly towards the underside of the branch, although it can develop around the entire circumference of the stem; it can reach 2 m in length. The crust is initially smooth, but cracks and becomes paler as it ages. Conidia are sometimes produced, on orange/red pustules scattered over the bark surface. Long black streaks of coagulated latex or gums appear on infected branches of Hevea or Theobroma, and open wounds develop as the bark cankers and splits.</item>
        <item>Management of P. salmonicolor and Pink Disease can be very difficult given its wide host range, making cross-infection a concern. Cultural control can be implemented by pruning frequently and burning any infected branches removed. This is effective when the disease can be recognized in the earliest stages, but it is most effective when performed concurrently with fungicide application. The encrustation and conidial pustules are able to remain functional for a period of time after the infected branches have been removed from the tree. Fungicide use varies among countries affected by the disease. In India, pre- and post-monsoon application of fungicides directly on the trunk and branches of cocoa or rubber trees effectively prevented the disease, while application of a sulphur-lime slurry to tea shrubs worked best in Kalimantan in Borneo, and Validamycin A was found to be the most effective means of control on rubber trees in Vietnam. The use of fungicides prevents the basidiospores from germinating and causing infection.</item>

        <item></item>
        <item>Symptoms of cadang-cadang develop slowly over 8 to 15 years making it difficult to diagnose at an early time. There are three main “stages” of defined series of characteristics: early, medium, and late stages. The first symptoms in the early stage develop within two to four years of infection. These symptoms include scarification of the coconuts which also become rounded. The leaves (fronds) display bright yellow spots. About two years later, during the medium stage, the inflorescences become stunted and eventually killed, so no more coconuts are produced. Yellow spots are larger and in greater abundance to give the appearance of chlorosis. During the final stage, roughly 6 years after the first symptoms are recorded, the yellow/bronze fronds start to decrease in size and number. Finally, all the leaves coalesce, leaving just the trunk of the palm “standing like a telephone pole”. Palms under 10 years of age are rarely affected by cadang-cadang; the incidence of disease increases until about 40 years of age and then plateaus. "No recovery has ever been observed, and the disease is always fatal". African oil palm has similar symptoms as coconut but also have orange spotting on palms.</item>

        <item>Phytophthora</item>
        <item>Leaves: yellow foliage and shoot die-back. If citrus weevils are present adults may feed on leaves causing notching. Fruit: reduced fruit size and yield. Trunk: Trunk - infection of the trunk by Phytophthora results in dark water soaked areas in the area of active infection. Lesions usually occur on the bark or at the bud union. Lesions may exude copious amount of gum and a brown necrotic area will be found under the bark lesions. Dead bark tends to break away from the trunk in vertical strips. Lesions may spread around the circumference of the trunk slowly girdling the tree. Whole tree: Phytophthora may result in poor tree health, thin canopy, failure to make new growth, and little water and nutrient uptake leading to wilting. When roots are infected the surface of the root becomes soft, discolored and appears water-soaked. Fibrous roots slough their cortex leaving only the white thread-like root cylinder.</item>
        <item>A tree demonstrating phytophthora symptoms can sometimes be saved by removing the soil from around the base of the tree all the way down to the top of the main roots, cutting away any bark that’s oozy or dark and leaving the root system exposed. This allows the root system to dry completely, slowing the spread of phytophthora. In most other cases, phytophthora management is limited to prevention. Trees and shrubs, like azaleas, should be planted in well-draining areas, so their roots remain dry for most of the day. Phytophthora only needs four hours of standing water to germinate, making it difficult to combat in areas with poor drainage. Some gardeners get around this by planting their landscaping on mounds 8 to 10 inches tall and being extra careful to plant crowns at the same depth they were at the nursery (often indicated by a dark line on the trunk). Well-established trees are less frequently affected than younger trees because they have widely spread roots that provide lots of avenues for water and nutrition. If a few sections are damaged, they are prepared to compensate. In smaller plants, such as shrubs or vegetables, all bets are off — they can be lost to phytophthora before you even realize the disease has taken hold.</item>

        <item>Pestalozzia palmarum</item>
        <item>It has been shown that the fungus usually requires wounds to infect the plant and necessary for the fungus to develop. The first symptoms of Pestalotiopsis palmarum begin as very small yellow, brown or black discoloration of the leaves. The disease can be restricted to the leaf blade or may only appear on the petiole and rachis right away. Spots and discoloration areas can be smaller than ¼ inch in size, but under optimal conditions can grow much larger eventually forming lesions. The spots will often turn a grayish color and will be outlined in black. Extreme wilting and a drying appearance on the leaves is also a major symptom of Pestalotiopsis palm. In mature palms, if the fungus is limited to only leaf spots, the disease may not be very serious and damaging. However, the fungus can severely affect juvenile plants if only a few leaf spots are present because they have yet to develop a trunk and only have a few leaves.</item>
        <item>Wind and water movement easily disperses spores of Pestalotiopsis palmarum so sanitation and irrigation management can be proven to be critical in preventing the movement of the disease. Wounds and damage to the plant offer easy access for the fungus so the limitation of human and insect activity can be very beneficial. Limiting the length of time that the leaves are wet when exposed to high humidity levels also reduces the risk of inoculation. So eliminating overhead irrigation can prevent infection on leaves when there is favorable humid weather. Nutrient management is also very important in controlling Pestalotopsis palmarum. Nutrient deficiencies can cause chlorosis and necrosis of leaf tissue which then in turn creates a wound necessary for disease inoculation. Based on the amount of disease on the leaves, pruning the leaves may treat the disease, but one needs to decide if pruning the leaves is worth the nutrient deficiency that could follow depending on the growth stage of the plant. Fungicides are also available for managing the disease, but alone will not solve the problem. Fungicides will prevent infection of healthy leaves, but infected leaves will stay infected until the leaf dies. Using multiple techniques for managing Pestalotiopsis palmarum at the same time is recommended for optimal management of the disease.</item>

        <item>The diagnostic symptom is the conspicuous black stain coming from a hole or wound and seeping down the coconut stem. At first there is a soft, slowly expanding stem decay that blackens with age. Darkly pigmented liquid bleeds down the trunk from the point of infection, covering the stem surface with a black layer of fluids. A cavity may develop beneath the affected area. Over the years, the fungal invasion of the interior stem can rot the stem entirely, causing plant decline and death. Basal stem invasion may occur in wet areas, producing a black collar of diseased stem tissue at the plant-soil interface. Roots may be blackened and decayed. A reddish-brown liquid oozes from cracks and holes in the stem. It seeps out and runs down the stem, turning black and staining the stem as it dries.</item>
        <item>Prevention and avoidance: Avoid wounding palm trunks at all stages of growth, maintenance, and during their harvest and transport for installation in a landscape. Do not drive stakes into palm trunks to secure them to trucks. Avoid contact of wounded palm stems with soil. Do not install sprinkler irrigation emitters that spray water on coconut trunks. Place irrigation emitters at least 12 inches from a coconut palm and direct them away from the trunk. Inspect plants for symptoms regularly; early treatment carries the best chance for success. Minimize stress by providing the palm with adequate nutrition, maintaining equable levels of soil moisture, and avoiding unnecessary cosmetic pruning. Avoid using spikes to climb the palms for pruning maintence. Treatment: For early infections, chisel or scrape out the rotten portion. Treat wounded or infected areas with fungicide and tar (for example, Bordeaux paste, mancozeb, or copper oxychloride), followed by sealing with coal tar two days later. Burn or destroy the chiseled pieces. Apply neem cake to the base of affected plants. Advanced symptoms may be virtually untreatable, requiring palm removal and destruction. Weakened coconut palms with rotting stems may be a toppling hazard in high winds</item>
